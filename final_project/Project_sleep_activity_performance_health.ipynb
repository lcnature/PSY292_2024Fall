        "The dataset was collected by Fitbits on activity (number of steps taken by a student) and sleep as well as some data related to academic performance in a class and in general. You can use the dataset to examine how overall amount of steps and sleep are related to academic outcomes, or evaluate the effects of sleep variability (the opposite of sleep consistency) on academic outcomes. Studies have shown that sleep variability is more strongly related to grades than overall sleep. Of course, you can also ask any other interesting questions from this dataset.\n",
