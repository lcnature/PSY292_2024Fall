Let's say that instead we want to bin each year separately.  We can do this using the `bins` argument to `plt.hist`. Because this argument takes a list of bins, we need to create a list that spans from the youngest to the oldest age.  We can do this using the `np.arange()` function from numpy, which generates a list of numbers that span a particular range. In this case, we need to span from the youngest to the oldest value, which are equivalent to the minimum and maximum values which we can obtain using the `.min()` and `.max()` operators. The addition of 2 is to ensure that every age group is placed into one single bin (the reason is related to how `plt.hist` decide whether the values at the boundary of each bin is counted into that bin and how `np.arange()` defines the boundary, which go too much into details)."
